I am **Jules Perret**, a PhD researcher and research engineer in gravitational astrophysics at the Astroparticle and Cosmology Laboratory (APC, CNRS). I work on data analysis for the LISA space mission, with a focus on Bayesian inference and advanced parameter estimation methods for compact binary systems, including binary neutron stars and binary black holes.

My research combines statistical inference, deep learning, and Hamiltonian-based sampling methods to accelerate and improve gravitational-wave parameter estimation. I have a strong interest in numerical simulations and high-performance computing, including large-scale parallel computing and GPU development for astrophysical applications.





## About Me
- Specializing in gravitational astrophysics and **gravitational waves** data analysis. 🔭
- Member of the **LIGO-Virgo-Kagra (LVK)** and **Einstein Telescope (ET)** collaborations. 💫
- Passionate about astrophysics, **numerical simulation**, and **HPC** programming 💻
