# Welcome

I am **Jules Perret**, a PhD researcher and research engineer in gravitational astrophysics at the Astroparticle and Cosmology Laboratory (APC, CNRS). My work focuses on data analysis for the **LISA space mission**, combining Bayesian inference and advanced computational methods to extract astrophysical insights from gravitational-wave signals.

I specialize in developing efficient parameter estimation techniques for compact binary systems—binary neutron stars and binary black holes—using statistical inference, deep learning, and Hamiltonian-based sampling methods. My research aims to accelerate gravitational-wave analysis while maintaining high accuracy, leveraging high-performance computing, GPU acceleration, and large-scale parallel simulations.
